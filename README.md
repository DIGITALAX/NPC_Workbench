The NPC Workbench combines an open-source Rust crate with a Drag and Drop Visual Interface for building **verifiably user-owned, decentralized, and encrypted** agent workflows.

While you can mix and match adapters, nodes, and links to create virtually any workflow, the Workbench's essence lies in enabling **meme agents**.

Why meme agents? Because memes are more than jokes—they’re cultural transactions, carrying the weight of ideas, identity, influence and are now actual **tokenized currency**. 

If **media control equals market participation**, then enabling access to markets starts with owning the mechanisms that drive your interactions.
